# simmer444 This is the prototype for the simmer444 website.
The challenge for today is to amalgamate the scratch-crud repo with the simmer-June16-2022 repo.

To check the username and email type 'git config user.name' or 'git config user.email.'

The final step in this process is to upload the files to the website and to Heroku.
